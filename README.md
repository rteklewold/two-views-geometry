# two-views-geometry


This repo contains the practical session related to two views geometry. 

The lab2_epipolar file contains feature points detection and matching using the ORB. Then there is an implementation of the 8 point algorithm to find the fundamental matrix. 

The lab2_stereo calculates a disparity map from stereo images and makes a 3D reconstruction by obtaining the depth values from the disparity map.
